# Given a binary array of size n where n > 3. A true (or 1)
# value in the array means active and false (or 0) means
# inactive.
#
# > Given a number k, the task is to find count of
# active and inactive cells after k days. After every day,
# status of iâ€™th cell becomes
# > active(i.e. 1) -> if left and right cells are different
#   inactive(i.e. 0) -> if left and right cell are same
#  (both 0 or both 1).
#
# Since there are no cells before leftmost and after rightmost
# cells, the value cells before leftmost and after rightmost
# cells is always considered as 0 (or inactive).
